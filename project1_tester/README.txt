Hello!

Copy in your autocomplete.c into this folder and try compiling / running the tester.c file.

"gcc tester.c autocomplete.c" followed with "./a.exe" (./a.out for linux & mac) worked for me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-I highly recommend using MS Visual Studio (not vs code) for c / c++ as it's dead stable and it has
a really nice debugger. Many people with vs code are having trouble properly debugging.

-While decimal places will not be tested, I have them inside the sample case as it's a good idea to
use atof apparently (according to piazza)

-Program by default goes through all the test cases

-There's also a function available to test specific test cases with more debugging information
